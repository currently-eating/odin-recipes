    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This dish is the perfect starter for a summer lunch outside.
        It features fresh heirloom cherry tomatoes, basil, good quality 
        olive oil, balsamic glaze, and of course, fresh burrata. Paired
        alongside garlic-rubbed grilled sourdough, it is the perfect way 
        to begin a meal with friends.
